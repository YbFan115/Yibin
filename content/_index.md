# About Me (Yibin Fan)

I am an undergraduate student majoring in communication at Renmin University in China, Beijing.

### Research Interest

The proliferation of online communities, especially those featured by peer production, has shown the potential of a new digital public life. Motivated by such a theoretical and public concern, I would like to promote the social scientific research by investigating online communities like Reddit, Wikipedia, and so on.

To tackle issues relevant about online communities, I use mostly quantitive and computational methods in my work. I also have some experiences in qualitative methods, including ethnographic fieldwork and archival study.

### Research Experience 
Now I am working as a research assistant in [Community Data Science Collective](https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page), which is a research group focused on studying online communities. I help to build dataset which relates two online communities ([Fandom Wiki](fandom.com) and [Reddit](reddit.com)) in the project. Here are my [notes](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/2021/08/30/ra-notes/) about what skills and ideas I have got from this experience.

More research experiences of mine can be found at the [Projects](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/projects/) or the [CV](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/cv/) page.

### Career Goal 
I am looking forward to becoming a scholar, which means I could create knowledge that matters for a better world. I expect my research to contribute to a sustainable progress towards a flourishing Internet, and help create the kind of change we wish to see in the future world.
