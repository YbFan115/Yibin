# About Me (Yibin Fan)

**Research Interest** My research interest broadly lies in how digital environment can promote human communication. Internet has brought social change, and I am passionately interested in two major aspects: how communities are reshaped by the development of technology in the digital environment, and how Internet brings human behavioral change. I am trying to make contributions on these two veins repsectively, and also figuring out ways to address a macro-micro link between them.

I use mostly quantative research methods in my work, such as experiment, questionnaire survey, and social network analysis. I also have some experience in qualitative methods including ethnography, historical analysis, and in-depth interviews.

**Research Experience** Now I am working as research assistant with [Nate](https://teblunthuis.cc), who is PhD candidate in the department of communication at University of Washington. I help to build dataset which relates two online communities ([Fandom Wiki](fandom.com) and [Reddit](reddit.com)) in the project. Here are my [notes](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/2021/08/30/ra-notes/) about what skills and ideas I have got from this experience.

There are more research experiences of mine which can be found at the [Projects](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/projects/) or the [CV](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/cv/) page.

**Course** I have taken interdisciplinary courses during my undergraduate learning at both [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) and [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu), which can be classified broadly into three categories: Theories, Research Methods, and Specific Topics. Look into the [Courses](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/courses/) page to know more about them.

**Career Goal** I am looking forward to becoming a scholar, which means I could create knowledge that matters for a better world. I expect my research to help create the kind of change we wish to see in the world, and contribute to a sustainable progress towards a flourishing Internet.
