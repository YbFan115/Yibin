# About Me (Yibin Fan)

I am an undergraduate student majoring in communication at Renmin University in China, Beijing.

### Research Interest
The proliferation of online communities shows how technology could cause a social change. I am passionately interested in online communities, and ask questions like how online communities relate to each other, and how behavioral change happens in the online communities. 

To tackle these issues, I use mostly quantitive methods in my work, such as experiment, survey, basic computational methods, and social network analysis. I also have some experiences in qualitative methods including fieldwork and historical analysis.

### Research Experience 
Now I am working as research assistant with [Nate](https://teblunthuis.cc), who is PhD candidate in the department of communication advised by [Benjamin Mako Hill](https://mako.cc) at University of Washington. I help to build dataset which relates two online communities ([Fandom Wiki](fandom.com) and [Reddit](reddit.com)) in the project. Here are my [notes](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/2021/08/30/ra-notes/) about what skills and ideas I have got from this experience.

More research experiences of mine can be found at the [Projects](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/projects/) or the [CV](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/cv/) page.

### Career Goal 
I am looking forward to becoming a scholar, which means I could create knowledge that matters for a better world. I expect my research to contribute to a sustainable progress towards a flourishing Internet, and help create the kind of change we wish to see in the future world.
