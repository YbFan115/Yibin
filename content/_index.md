# About Me (Yibin Fan)
I am an undergraduate majoring in communication in the [School of Journalism and Communication at Renmin University of China](http://jcr.ruc.edu.cn/English/index.htm), Beijing. 

My research interest focuses on how technology, especially Internet, can promote human communication. I am passionately interested in two major aspects: how communities are reshaped by the development of technology in the digital environment, and how technology use brings behavioral change. I am trying to make contributions on these two veins repsectively, and also figuring out ways to make a macro-micro link between them.

I expect my research to contribute to an sustainable progress towards a flourishing Internet. 

I use mostly quantative research methods in my work, such as experiment, questionnaire survey, and social network analysis. I also have some experience in qualitative methods including ethnography and in-depth interviews.
