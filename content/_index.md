# About Me (Yibin Fan)

I am an undergraduate student majoring in communication at Renmin University in China, Beijing.

### Research Interest
My research interest broadly lies in how digital technology can promote human communication and construct social change. I am passionately interested in two major aspects: how communities, group, and organizations are reshaped in the digital environment, and how Internet brings human behavioral change. I am trying to make contributions on these two veins repsectively, and also figuring out ways to address a macro-micro link between them.

To tackle these issues, I use mostly quantitive methods in my work, such as experiment, questionnaire, survey, basic computational methods, and social network analysis. I also have some experiences in qualitative methods including fieldwork and historical analysis.

### Research Experience 
Now I am working as research assistant with [Nate](https://teblunthuis.cc), who is PhD candidate in the department of communication at University of Washington. I help to build dataset which relates two online communities ([Fandom Wiki](fandom.com) and [Reddit](reddit.com)) in the project. Here are my [notes](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/2021/08/30/ra-notes/) about what skills and ideas I have got from this experience.

More research experiences of mine which can be found at the [Projects](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/projects/) or the [CV](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/cv/) page.

### Course 
I have taken interdisciplinary courses during my undergraduate learning at both [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) and [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu), which can be classified broadly into three categories: Theories, Research Methods, and Specific Topics. Look into the [Courses](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/courses/) page to know more about them.

### Career Goal 
I am looking forward to becoming a scholar, which means I could create knowledge that matters for a better world. I expect my research to contribute to a sustainable progress towards a flourishing Internet, and help create the kind of change we wish to see in the future world.
