This project begins with my coursework on Communication Cognition, which is a graduate-level senimar given by [Prof. Yegiyan](https://communication.ucdavis.edu/people/nyegiyan) at UC Davis. I accomplished the research proposal on this senimar and am collecting data now. Here is the abstract of the proposal:

## Abstract

### Background

### Theory and Hypotheses
- H1a: Adolescents fail their self-control by switching from one media to another when they feel less motivated in the previous ‘have-to-do’ tasks.
- H1b: Adolescents exert their self-control by switching from one media to another when they feel less motivated in the previous ‘want-to-do’ tasks.
- H2: Self-control failure can improve the affective well-being of adolescents.

### Methodology
- Experience Sampling Method
	Participants will be asked to think about what media multitasking behavior they have done, and fill in the following form three times a day during two weeks.
