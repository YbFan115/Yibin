## Abstract 
Internet and technology use have changed the government behavior. In China, a large number of government related official accounts on Weibo (which is a Chinese online platform like Twitter) has been run to better conduct governance. The current project is focused on a typical set of official accounts run by the departments of local government, using mixed methods to comprehensively understand the mechanics and effects of the mediated government behavior.

### Study 1: How it runs - collaboration and coordination.
- Method: We conducted interviews with 7 official masters of different departments in the local government, who are running the Weibo accounts as all or part of their daily work.
- Findings:

### Study 2: Governance, propoganda, or both?
- Method: We pulled the data of all the local governance related tweets from 2015 to 2021 by Python. 

- Findings:
    1. The data consist of 1711 tweets, among which 1199 tweets are reposted by the coordinator account, which means only around one third in the amount of tweets are truly from those residents who used Weibo to pose local problems. The coordination account repost the tweet to conduct the collaboration with the departments and to show off the government was playing its role in governance.

    2. According to the interaction in tweets, we visualized the coordinator-centered network:

    3. Then we moved the accounts whose node degree (mean = 14, SD = 19) is lower than mean value, and added the collaboration among other accounts. There appears three clusters, which are verified to be related to the public transport and city planning.
