By computational methods, we try to find out how associated the fandom wikis and subreddits are, to further find out the features of the intergroup relationship.
I am playing a role in building the dataset. Here are my notes about how we organize the data, and what skills and ideas I have got from the project.</description></item><item><title>Media Multitasking and Emotional Change</title><link>https://YbFan115.github.io/en/2021/09/10/media-multitasking-and-emotional-change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 15:20:11 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://YbFan115.github.io/en/2021/09/10/media-multitasking-and-emotional-change/</guid><description>This project begins with my coursework on Communication Cognition, which is a graduate-level senimar given by Prof. Yegiyan at UC Davis. I accomplished the research proposal on this senimar and am collecting data now. Here is the abstract of the proposal:
Abstract Background Theory and Hypotheses H1a: Adolescents fail their self-control by switching from one media to another when they feel less motivated in the previous ‘have-to-do’ tasks. H1b: Adolescents exert their self-control by switching from one media to another when they feel less motivated in the previous ‘want-to-do’ tasks.</description></item><item><title>Listening to the ancient opera: Sound studies and media history</title><link>https://YbFan115.github.io/en/2021/09/10/listening-to-the-ancient-opera-sound-studies-and-media-history/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 15:19:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://YbFan115.github.io/en/2021/09/10/listening-to-the-ancient-opera-sound-studies-and-media-history/</guid><description>Abstract:</description></item><item><title>Mediated Governance in China</title><link>https://YbFan115.github.io/en/2021/09/10/mediated-governance-in-china/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:49:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://YbFan115.github.io/en/2021/09/10/mediated-governance-in-china/</guid><description>Undergraduate research project, 09/20 - 05/21 Poster presentation on undergraduate academic works competition Advisor: Associate Professor Yan Yan (Ph.D. in communication at University of Alabama) Background Internet and technology use have changed the government behavior. In China, a large number of government related official accounts on Weibo (which is a Chinese online platform like Twitter) has been run to better conduct governance. The current project is focused on a typical set of official accounts run by departments of the local government in a particular district, using mixed methods to comprehensively understand the coordination, collaboration, and effects of the mediated government behavior.</description></item></channel></rss>
